            Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
            Those cats were fast as lightning
            In fact, it was a little bit frightening
            But they fought with expert timing
            There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
            They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
            It's an ancient Chinese art, and everybody knew their part
            From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip
            Everybody was Kung Fu fighting (huh!)
            Those cats were fast as lightning</div>
            In fact, it was a little bit frightening (hey, yeah)
            But they fought with expert timing
            There was funky Billy Chin, and little Sammy Chung
            He said, "Here comes the big boss, let's get it on"
            We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
            A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand-new trip
            Everybody was Kung Fu fighting (huh!)
            Those cats were fast as lightning (ha!)
            In fact, it was a little bit frightening (huh!)
            But they did it with expert timing (ha!)
            Oh, yeah

            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) ha!
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) ha!
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) ha!
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha) keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

            Sure enough
            Everybody was Kung Fu fighting (huh!)
            Those cats were fast as lightning (ha!)
            In fact, it was a little bit frightening (huh!)
            Make sure you have expert timing, oh (ha!)
            Kung Fu fighting

            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) hands and feet fast as lightning
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) huh! Ha!
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) huh! Ha!
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) huh!
            Keep on, keep on, keep on (ha!)
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho) huh!
            Yeah, yeah (ha!)
            (Oh-ho-ho-ho)
