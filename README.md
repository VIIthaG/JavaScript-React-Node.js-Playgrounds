# What's in Here? 
- Beginner scripts and snippets — from console logs to basic logic.
- React components — playing with props, state, hooks, and routing.
-Node.js experiments — setting up servers, working with files, building simple APIs.
- Miscellaneous code — stuff I wrote just to see if it would work (and sometimes it did!).
