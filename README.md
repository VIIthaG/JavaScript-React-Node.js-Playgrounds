# What's in Here? 
- Beginner scripts and snippets — from console logs to basic logic.
- React components — playing with props, state, hooks, and routing.
-Node.js experiments — setting up servers, working with files, building simple APIs.
- Miscellaneous code — stuff I wrote just to see if it would work (and sometimes it did!).

# How to use this ?
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaScript-React-Node.js---Playgrounds-.git
- cd JavaScript-React-Node.js---Playgrounds-



This repository is a personal playground for my early experiments with JavaScript, React, and Node.js. It contains all the code I wrote when I was just getting started with these technologies, from basic scripts to exploratory projects. Over time, it’s become a space where I return to try out ideas, revisit core concepts, or just mess around with code without any particular structure or goal. You’ll find everything from simple console logs and component tests to API experiments and server setups. This isn’t meant to be a polished or organized project—just a reflection of learning in progress, trial and error, and the curiosity that got me started with web development in the first place.
